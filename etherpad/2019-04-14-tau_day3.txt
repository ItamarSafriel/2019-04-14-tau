For list of commands type: .help
For list of tables in database type: .tables
The commands:
     .mode column 
     .headers on
Make things readable

To get the info on the table "data" type:
PRAGMA table_info(data); 

To select rows from this table use:
    SELECT <name(s) of row> FROM <name of table> LIMIIT <number of rows you wish to see>
You can add multiple conditions (e.g !=,=,<,>) using WHERE  - separated by AND

Add ORDER BY <name of row> to sort results
[default is ascending, for descending add DESC after row name]

When joining tables, if there is a variable that appears in both tables you can identify a particular one by writing:
    <table name>.<row name>
    

For later today, please install the astroquery module:
	    conda install -c astropy astroquery
To check if this worked:
    python -c 'import astroquery'
If nothing happens, that means it worked.

jupyer notebook
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("/Users/griffin/Downloads/hipparcos.db")

to plot things in the Jupyter notebook, you need:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    
pip install --upgrade --pre astroquery
